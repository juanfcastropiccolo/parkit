# parkit_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

### Android setup

Before building the Android app you must create a `android/local.properties`
file pointing to your Android SDK installation, e.g.

```
sdk.dir=/path/to/Android/sdk
```

This file is ignored by Git so every developer needs to maintain their own
version locally.
